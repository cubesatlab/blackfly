\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapt-introductin}

This document is a copy of a generic SRS template. Edit the sections with extreme prejudice to make them more appropriate for our project! Because this project is currently very immature, detailed requirements are not yet known (as of May 1, 2021). This document primarily contains a collection of questions to guide discussion as requirements are clarified.

\section{Purpose}
% Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in
% this document, including the revision or release number. Describe
% the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly
% if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.

\section{Document Conventions}
\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
% Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended
% for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users,
% testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this
% SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading
% the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding
% through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.

\section{References}
% List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS
% refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts,
% standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents,
% or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that
% the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title,
% author, version number, date, and source or location.
