\label{chap:nonfunctional}

\section{Performance Requirements}
% If there are performance requirements for the product under various
% circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help
% the developers understand the intent and make suitable design
% choices. Specify the timing relationships for real time
% systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may
% need to state performance requirements for individual functional
% requirements or features.

\section{Safety Requirements}
% Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss,
% damage, or harm that could result from the use of the
% product. Define any safeguards or actions that must be taken, as
% well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to any external
% policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the
% product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must
% be satisfied.

\section{Security Requirements}
% Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss,
% damage, or harm that could result from the use of the
% product. Define any safeguards or actions that must be taken, as
% well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to any external
% policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the
% product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must
% be satisfied.

\question{To what extent should we be concerned about people on the ground a) monitoring the
  traffic to/from the spacecraft(s), and b) taking control of the spacecraft(s) by sending
  commands of their own? In other words: do we need to have confidentiality or data integrity in
  the earth to spacecraft communications link? What about the spacecraft to spacecraft link?}

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
% Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that
% will be important to either the customers or the developers. Some to
% consider are: adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility,
% interoperability, maintainability, portability, reliability,
% reusability, robustness, testability, and usability. Write these to
% be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when possible. At the
% least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, such
% as ease of use over ease of learning.

\begin{description}
\item[Quality.AORTE] The codebase shall be written in \SPARK\ and proved to be free of runtime
  errors in the sense meant by \SPARK. Certain, limited exceptions are allowed, but they must be
  documented.
\end{description}

\section{Business Rules}
% List any operating principles about the product, such as which
% individuals or roles can perform which functions under specific
% circumstances. These are not functional requirements in themselves,
% but they may imply certain functional requirements to enforce the
% rules.

\section{Other Requirements}
% Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This
% might include database requirements, internationalization
% requirements, legal requirements, reuse objectives for the project,
% and so on. Add any new sections that are pertinent to the project.
