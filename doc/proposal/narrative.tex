\section{Project Narrative}


For this mission, the three CubeSats, which are initially separated
from one another in radial velocities by $0.1 m/s$, will autonomously
and optimally fire their thrusters to get into an intermediate
triangular formation after $\frac{1}{3}$ of an orbital period (1861
seconds), and then fire their thrusters again to get into a final
linear formation after one full orbital period (5582 seconds).

This is achieved by solving an optimization problem on-board the
CubeSat computers. The optimization problem is a mixed-integer linear
program, and calculates the thruster timing, duration, and magnitude
to achieve collision-free formation with minimum fuel usage. In the
optimization problem, we assume that all three satellites start from
the same initial positions (origin in local vertical local horizontal
or LVLH frame), make an intermediate triangular formation, and end up
on a linear formation where they are spatially separated about $478.8m$
(calculated from data available to us) from one another after one
orbital period in along-track direction.

For the calculations and figures that follow, we assumed the following
orbital parameters for the initial center of mass of the three
satellites, but these parameters can be adapted to any circular low
earth orbit:

\begin{itemize}
  \item semi major axis $a = 6800 Km$
  \item Eccentricity $e = 0$
  \item Right ascension of the ascending node $(RAAN):-0.01675^{\circ}$
  \item Geodesic latitude $\omega = 0^{\circ}$
  \item True anomaly $v = 0^{\circ}$
  \item Inclination angle $i = 25^{\circ}$
\end{itemize}

The optimization problem uses the linearized J2-perturbed dynamics,
which are shown to be accurate in the timescales under consideration
for circular orbits. We assume our thruster capability is within:

\[[-10, 10] mN\]

These optimal control and maneuvers are obtained as a solution to a
trajectory optimization (TO) problem, formulated as a mixed-integer
linear program, given below. This TO problem has two parts – in the
first part we obtain fuel optimal trajectories, controls and
assignments to move from the origin to a ``triangular formation'' in
LVLH frame and from the second part we find optimal trajectories,
controls and assignments as the satellites move from the triangular
formation to a final linear formation. For simplicity, we provide here
the basic structure of the minimum fuel TO algorithm, which is
replicated twice for different $t_f$'s (for example $T/3$ in the first
case and $2T/3$ in the second) and different final points (for
example, vertices of the triangular formation in the first case, three
equidistant points on a straight line for the second case).

$min J_{|u,x|} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{p=0}^{Q-1} \sum_{k=1}^{v} | u_{ik} (P)|$
subject to
\begin{itemize}
\item State space constraints:
  $x_i(p+1) = Ax_i(p)+Bu_i(p)$ with $i = 1,2,...,N$ and $p = 0,1,2,...,T-1$,
\item initial state $x_i(0) = x_{iS}$,
\item final configuration constraint
  $x_{iT} = \sum_{j=1}^{N}b_{ij}x_{jD}$
  with $\sum_{i=1}^{N}b_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^{N}b_{ij} = 1$,
  where $b_{ij}$
  is a binary variable and responsible for deciding the assignment of
  each of these final positions to a satellite,
\item actuator saturation constraint $u_{k,max} \leq u_{ik}(p) \leq u_{k,max}$.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:trajectories} presents the trajectories of the three
satellites undergoing aforementioned maneuvers along the way. Starting
point is marked with ``x'', intermediate triangle formation is shown
with red and all three terminal points are marked with squares in
respective colors. All axes represent the satellite coordinates in the
LVLH frame relative to the target orbit defined by the above orbital
parameters.

The actuation forces which allow the satellites to complete these
maneuvers are shown in Figure \ref{fig:orbitals}.

These actuation profiles can be coupled with magnetorquers to compute
the final thrust vectors for each satellite.

In the following table, we present the absolute impulsive actuations
by each CubeSat in making these maneuvers possible.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Index & Absolute Impulsive Actuation $(\int_{0}^{T} (|u_x| + |u_y| + |u_z|) dt)$\\
\hline
Sat-1 & 10.8154 N-s\\
Sat-2 & 17.1647 N-s\\
Sat-3 & 19.0752 N-s\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\\

Total absolute impulsive actuation by three satellites is
$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \int_{0}^{T} (|u_{xi}(t)| + |u_{yi}(t)| + |u_{zi}(t)|) dt = 47.0553$ N-s.

CubedOS is being developed at Vermont Technical College’s CubeSat
Laboratory with the purpose of providing a robust software platform
for CubeSat missions and of easing the development of CubeSat flight
software. In many respects the goals of CubedOS are similar to those
of the Core Flight Executive (cFE) written by NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center and F’ developed by NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. However, unlike cFE and F’,
CubedOS is written in SPARK and verified to be free of the possibility
of runtime error. SPARK has also been used to provide some other
correctness properties in certain cases.  Although CubedOS was
developed to support the CubeSat missions at Vermont Technical
College, the intent is for CubedOS to be general enough and modular
enough for other groups to profitably employ the system. Since every
mission uses different hardware and has different software
requirements, CubedOS is designed as a framework into which modules
can be plugged to implement whatever mission functionality is
required. CubedOS provides inter-module communication and other common
services required by many missions. CubedOS thus serves both as a kind
of operating environment and as a library of useful tools and
functions. CubedOS modules are written in Spark and, at a minimum,
proved free of runtime error. However, CubedOS also allows modules, or
parts of modules, to be written in full Ada or C if desired. This
allows CubedOS to take advantage of third party C libraries or to
integrate with an existing C code base. It is a work in progress to
create a bridge between CubedOS and CFS so that current CFS users can
experiment with CubedOS and eventually migrate mission critical
components to CubedOS. The architecture of CubedOS is a collection of
modules, each containing one or more Ada tasks. Although CubedOS is
written in Spark there need not be a one-to-one correspondence between
CubedOS modules and Spark packages. In fact, modules are routinely
written as a collection of Spark packages in a package hierarchy.
Critical to the plug-and-play nature of CubedOS, each module is
self-contained and does not make direct use of any code that is
private to another module. However, CubedOS does allow shared library
packages to be written for holding utility subprograms of various
kinds. The CubedOS distribution includes a collection of such library
packages that are used by CubedOS core modules, but that can also be
used by application modules. In the language of operating systems,
CubedOS can be said to have a microkernel architecture where task and
memory management is provided by the Ada runtime system. Both low
level facilities, such as device drivers, and high level facilities,
such as communication protocol handlers, are all implemented as
CubedOS modules. All modules are treated equally by CubedOS; any
layered structuring of the modules is imposed by programmer
convention.

Naturally, there are environmental impacts associated with the development and launch of any spacecraft through rocket fuel exhaust, upstream materials and manufacturing costs, and simply the presence of human-made infrastructure in LEO. This project aims to limit environmental impact by adhering to the most rigorous launch vehicle requirements to avoid damage and waste, using as many non-toxic and sustainable materials as possible, and building for a long-lasting mission. Note that the Benchmark thruster system using non-toxic inert propellant which is an environmentally form of propellant and is safe for the launch vehicles as well. There is potential for this project to play a role in improving environmental impacts. Synthetic aperture radar can be used for Earth imaging and CubeSat swarms can be developed for climate and Earth surveys as well as for security.
