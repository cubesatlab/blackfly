\section{Statement of Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Determine success of autonomous control algorithms in
    maneuvering a three CubeSat swarm from an initial formation to a
    final formation in orbit.
  \item Investigate potential for inert, non-toxic propulsion systems
    for in attitude control and orbit maneuvers of 1U CubeSats.
  \item Optimize inter-university and community collaboration in space
  \item Build upon previous mission success of VT Lunar CubeSat
    through proven technologies and best practices
  \item Test robustness of CubedOS flight software development
    platform in operating a multi-satellite swarm exploration and
    spacecraft development.
  \item Explore the feasibility of PCB-integrated magnetorquers in
    increasing volume budget while maintaining pointing requirements.
  \item Establish university satellite program at the University of
    Vermont in conjunction with Vermont Technical College.
  \item Implement JT65 radio protocol in a multi-CubeSat communication mission through CubedOS.
  \item Inspire a passion for space exploration and spacecraft development in the next generation of engineers.
  \item Educate students in various aspects of spacecraft design through lectures, workshops, hands-on fabrication, literature reviews, and experiential learning.
\end{itemize}
