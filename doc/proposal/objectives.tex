\begin{itemize}
  \item Determine success of autonomous control algorithms in
    maneuvering a 3 CubeSat swarm from an initial launch position to a
    final formation in orbit.
  \item Investigate potential for inert, non-toxic propulsion systems
    for in attitude control and orbit maneuvers of 1U CubeSats.
  \item Optimize inter-university and community collaboration in space
    exploration and spacecraft development.
  \item Explore the feasibility of PCB-integrated magnetorquers in
    increasing volume budget while maintaining pointing requirements.
  \item Establish university satellite program at the University of
    Vermont in conjunction with Vermont Technical College.
\end{itemize}
